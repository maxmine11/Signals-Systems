%You can use the Matlab functions hex2dec and dec2hex to check your answers.
%Three hexadecimal pairs are equivalent to 24 bits because the maximum
%number is 15 and minimum is zero per hexadecimal (that means 16 options
%per hexadecimal) We can re present each number with 4 bits and since there
%are 6 numbers we need 6x4 bits = 24bits
